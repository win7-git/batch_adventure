Hey Guys!
This is the *official* repository for Batch Adventure. It is an entirely open-source project. Featuring the Windows Batch File Languange, you can download either a compiled Windows executable (thanks to The Bat to Exe Converter v1.6 from f2ko.de), or the original source code. Happy exploring!
